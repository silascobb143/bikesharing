# Bikesharing Anaysis 

#Overview
For this analysis, we were tasked to use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, we created a set of visualizations to:

*Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
*Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
*Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, youâ€™ll add these new visualizations to our final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

The purpose of the analysis is well defined. (5 pt)
